I am really late coming to this train.  This has been on my list since the
day it was released, and today I finally found the time to sit alone and
digest.

To say that it was "emotionally moving" would be a gross misrepresentation
of the film.  There were clearly some aspects added for dramatic effect, but
if you strip away (for example) the demonization of the opposition's
actions, the proceedings remain absolutely _astounding_ and the results
entirely heartbreaking.

That a society which claims to be as advanced as ours does (technologically,
morally, socially, militarily, etc) could demoralize an individual in this
manner seems terminally and criminally corrupt.

When my filesystem gets corrupted, I try to desperately salvage any of the
useful information (usually while trying to salvage the entire filesystem),
and once my efforts have proven to have provided all the fruits they
possibly can, I proceed to format the drive and begin again.  Sometimes, a
system needs to be rebooted.  A fresh install of the operating system
usually extends the life of a system by a measurable amount of time.

Perhaps reinstalling our base operating system is worth a try?
