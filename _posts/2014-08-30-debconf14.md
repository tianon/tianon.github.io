title:  DebConf14

I was given the opportunity to attend DebConf in Portland this year, and I
must say that it took me entirely by surprise (as a first-time attendee).

Most conferences have several strong talk tracks and you end up spending a
lot of time sitting in talks wondering when they'll be over.  At DebConf,
there's an entirely different dynamic, with a strong focus on what they like
to call "the hallway track" (which this year has taken place a lot in the
hacklabs, too).  Everyone here wants to either talk about building cool
stuff, or sit down and actually build some cool stuff.  A large number of
the talks are just launchpads for informal Q+As or actual hack sessions.

By coming, I've learned a lot about the Debian community and how it operates
as a whole, and managed to meet a lot of very interesting and cool people
(not to mention getting a bunch of them to sign my GPG key, which is also
nice).

Hopefully I'll be able to attend more DebConfs in the future, because I've
had a great time!
