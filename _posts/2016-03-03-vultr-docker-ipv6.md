title:  Docker on VULTR + IPv6
---

I've been using [VULTR](https://www.vultr.com) for a little while now and have been generally very pleased (especially with the very recent facelift the management portal received).  I don't want to waste too much time talking about it, but the "killer feature" for me (over some of their competitors like [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)) is that I can provide a raw ISO and provision my VM directly using it as I would any local VM (which also means that once my VM is up and working, I get to use the OS's standard kernel, which is especially important for using Debian Unstable well).

Anyhow, already too much about that -- let's get to the cool stuff.

Getting right down to the beef, let's assume I've got a VULTR instance already created, my OS is already installed and working, I've enabled IPv6 within VULTR, ensured that my VM is able to `ping6 google.com` (to verify at least basic routability), _and_ have Docker version 1.10.2 installed.

For the sake of demonstration, we'll assume that VULTR has assigned my IPv6 as follows: (available under the VM details via `Settings > IPv6`)

- Default IP: `2001:db8::5400:00ff:fe20:2295`
- Network: `2001:db8::`
- CIDR: 64

(The astute reader may recognize [RFC3849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849) here. üòè)

The relevant documentation which helped me get to the working state outlined below is in [the "IPv6 with Docker" section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/).

The first step I took was creating a systemd drop-in file so that I could modify the daemon startup parameters (to include `--ipv6` and `--fixed-cidr-v6`):

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/docker.service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6 2001:db8::/80
```

I chose to use just `/80` for Docker -- any other reasonable prefix (assuming it is routed to your host / host network) should also work; the documentation I linked above has an example using a `/125`, for example.

With this half in place, I can `systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl restart docker.service`, and when I start a container it will be automatically assigned an IPv6 address from within that prefix.  Excellent.

An important caveat to note is that this _will_ break discovery on our host due to Docker enabling forwarding for us, so (assuming your "internet-facing" interface is named `ens3` for the sake of illustration; it might just as easily be `eth0`, `eth1`, `enps3`, `lan0`, `wlan0`, etc) I had to `sysctl net.ipv6.conf.ens3.accept_ra=2`, and I added it to `/etc/sysctl.d/docker-ipv6.conf` for good measure (so that I don't lose it after I reboot).

The second half of our IPv6 to containers problem is routing.  The nitty-gritty details of this are discussed in [the "Using NDP proxying" section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/#using-ndp-proxying) of the documentation, but the gist is that my containers have IPv6 addresses, but the outside world doesn't have a route that leads to them, and that we need to tell the kernel to respond to solicitations for our container's IPv6 addresses appropriately.

The kernel has a mechanism for doing so (via `ip -6 neigh ...`), but it is limited to individual addresses and is thus not especially great for having a solution that works "magically" without further manual labor per-container.

This is where [ndppd](https://github.com/DanielAdolfsson/ndppd) (also [packaged for Debian as `ndppd`](https://packages.debian.org/sid/ndppd)) came in.

```nginx
# /etc/ndppd.conf
proxy ens3 {
	rule 2001:db8::/80 {
	}
}
```

After getting this configuration in place and restarting `ndppd` (`systemctl restart ndppd`), magic happened.  My containers could `ping6 google.com`, and my other IPv6 hosts could `ping6` the IPv6 addresses of my individual containers!

You've probably noted that this configuration isn't exactly secure, since it means that each of my individual containers has a _publicly_ routable IPv6 address, but for this specific use case, I'm OK with that! üç¶
