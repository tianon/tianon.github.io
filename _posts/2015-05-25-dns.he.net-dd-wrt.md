title:  DD-WRT + dns.he.net (DDNS / inadyn)
---

The DD-WRT wiki hilariously has [a page about this](https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Dynamic_DNS#he.net), but it's not very helpful and [account creation is entirely disabled](https://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=137570), so here goes a blog post for my own future reference:

In the [dns.he.net control panel](https://dns.he.net), enable the hostname (`HOSTNAME`) for "dynamic dns".  Click the DDNS icon and generate a "key" (`KEY`), which will be used as the password for updating.

In the DD-WRT control panel, under "Setup > DDNS" (at least in `Firmware: DD-WRT v24-sp2 (02/19/14) std`), set "DDNS Service" to `Custom`, set "DYNDNS Server" to `dyn.dns.he.net`, set "Username" to `HOSTNAME`, set "Password" to `KEY`, set "Hostname" to `HOSTNAME`, and set "URL" to `/nic/update?hostname=`.

Whala.
